# mm
I wanted to name this app **srm** for **s**afe **rm**, but that is already a Unix tool. So **rrm** for **r**eliable **rm** was suggested. Only looking at it looked too close to **mm**, and that was what was decided upon. 

The idea is to make a command line tool that is a drop-in replacement for rm which follows the trash standard used by Linux desktops.
